# Why i build second portfolio website with similar design?
I started making a new website with a similar design to the previous one, as I was advised by a colleague that my previous design wasn't good enough and wasn't up-to-date for the current time. Instead of modifying my old website, i started a new one and tried to create a different design that would be appealing, but still to my taste. And again, this website was never launched because once again, I DIDN'T LIKE IT.

# The conclusion
The conclusion I can give for people who are making a Portfolio website is make one that covers most of your requirements and claims, but not be perfect. I think my conclusion carries weight as I was caught in a cycle of doing the same thing over and over again, but in a different way and ended up getting nowhere.
